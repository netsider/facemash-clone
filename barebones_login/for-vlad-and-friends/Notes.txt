Notes I thought might help those helping me:

Sorry if there's code in here that makes it hard to run on your machine, if you're trying to actually get it to run (I just figured maybe you could see right away what the problem is/was).  I'm working on a version that doesn't use the database or any files, so sharing is easier.

All Files in the /views DIRECTORY should be the same in both versions.

Only the index.js files should differ (at least in what they do):

Attempt #1:	 
After visiting /login, the rendered view file sends an XHR request to /loggedin, which then tries to verify the token and return the next() function and render node-dopple-login-success, but fails.

Attempt #2:
After visiting /login, the rendered view file sends an XHR request to /loggedin, which then tries to verify the token and render node-dopple-login-success, but fails.

Attempt #3:
This is the most successful attempt, but after verifying the token, it still doesn't render the login page.  No idea.

Attempt #5: The first one to actually work, but it still only logs the user in and doesn't keep them logged in.
